  Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a graduate student pursuing an MSBA at the University of Utah's David Eccles School of Business, set to graduate in December 2023. 
  Currently employed as a Product Compliance Analyst at Liberty Mutual Insurance, I bring a blend of academic knowledge and practical experience. 
  My skill set includes proficiency in Python, R, Tableau, PowerBi, and SQL. Explore my capstone project to see how I leverage these skills in real-world applications.
